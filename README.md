# Main project goal
Main project goal is to create scalable framework with allure reporter. It's almost start of the project but we will expand in case what we start. We will cover more than 100 E2E tests with clean codebase.
At this project we use POM pattern, Allure reporter and TypeScript. We need to test only with Chrome and we need to run each suite separately.

# Your task
You need to review the project, define it mistakes and give your suggestion that will help the project be scalable, maintable and correct according to description. Use your previous experience to make your best and ensure project automation will move smoothly.
Good luck
